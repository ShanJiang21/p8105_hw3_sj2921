## Problem 1

``` r
# Set the graph properties(theme, color and size) for ggplot
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

  - Import the
    data

  - structure data: Response indicating the proportion of subjects with
    each
response

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Convert response to build a factor; Specify the levels of response_vector
response <- 
  factor(brfss_df$response, 
  levels <- (c("Excellent","Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

##### Questions

  - 1.In 2002, CT, MT, NH, NM, OR, TN, UT were observed at 7 locations.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
 brfss_df %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  distinct(locationdesc) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 2
    ##   locationabbr     n
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 MT               7
    ## 3 NH               7
    ## 4 NM               7
    ## 5 OR               7
    ## 6 TN               7
    ## 7 UT               7

  - 2.Make a spaghetti plot showing the number of observations in each
    state from 2002 to 2010

<!-- end list -->

``` r
location <- brfss_df %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) 

ggplot(location, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3, aes(group = locationabbr)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of observations in each state(n) from 2002 to 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of observations in each state(n)",
    caption = "Data from the BRFSS package"
  ) + scale_color_hue(name = "locationabbr", 
                  h = c(200, 300))
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_sj2921_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />
\* 3. Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean
and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across
locations in NY State.

``` r
 brfss_df %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & response == "Excellent") %>%
  filter(year == "2002" | year == "2006" | year == "2010") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ex = mean(data_value),
            sd_ex = sd(data_value)) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##    year mean_ex sd_ex
    ##   <int>   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1  2002    24.0  4.49
    ## 2  2006    22.5  4.00
    ## 3  2010    22.7  3.57

  - 4.1 For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each
    response category (taking the average across locations in a state).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
panel <- brfss_df %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            avg_pro = mean(data_value))
```

  - 4.2 Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category
    separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over
    time.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ggplot(panel, aes(x = year, y = avg_pro )) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# problem 2

##### The dataset cleaning and summarizing

**Instacart Dataset description**

1.  There are **1384617 observations** and **15** variables in the
    dataset. The dataset is a long dataset using the order\_id and
    user\_id as main keys.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(department) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(dep_ranking = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(dep_ranking > 20 | dep_ranking < 4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 3
    ##   department      n dep_ranking
    ##   <chr>       <int>       <int>
    ## 1 bulk         1359          21
    ## 2 dairy eggs 217051           2
    ## 3 produce    409087           1
    ## 4 snacks     118862           3

2.  We know that there are in total 21 departments. According to the
    ranking for no.of orders in each department, the 3 top-ranked
    department are **produce, dairy eggs and snacks**. The produce
    department has received 409087 orders which are the double of the
    second-ranked dairy eggs. The least popular department is **bulk**,
    which only has 1359 orders.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# The most 
instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(user_id) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(user_ranking = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(user_ranking < 3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 3
    ##   user_id     n user_ranking
    ##     <int> <int>        <int>
    ## 1  149753    80            1
    ## 2  197541    80            1

3.  The one who has the highest purchasing power among users are the two
    **user\_id:149753, user\_id:197541**.Both of them have 80 orders and
    they have maintained a high reorder rate.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pro_ranking = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(pro_ranking < 3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 3
    ##   product_name               n pro_ranking
    ##   <chr>                  <int>       <int>
    ## 1 Bag of Organic Bananas 15480           2
    ## 2 Banana                 18726           1

4.  The most popular product are **Bananas** which appeared in 18726
    orders. Bag of Organic Bananas, following as the second, they
    appeared in 15480 orders, so the supply of bananas should be
    addressed.

## Questions

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

2.  Graph spaghetti plot that shows the number of observations in each
    state from 2002 to 2010

3.  
4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
